                        This information is only relevant for advanced users. In general,
                        it is not needed to deal with simulation islands directly and
                        users can safely ignore this simulation detail.

                    In each frame the simulation creates different batches of bodies and constraints
                    that can be simulated independently. Such a batch is called
                    <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:DigitalRise.Physics.SimulationIsland</codeEntityReference>.
                    Every time rigid bodies can influence each other via constraints (contacts
                    or joints), they belong to the same island.

                <para>
                    Islands can only sleep as a whole. It is not possible that some bodies in
                    an island are sleeping and others are awake. If one object is awake, all
                    objects are awake because the movement of the active body can propagate to
                    the other bodies. In unfortunate configurations a jittering body can
                    keep a whole island awake.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Static or kinematic rigid bodies are not managed in islands. They are not
                    part of another island and they are not in their own island. Islands only
                    contain dynamic rigid bodies. (But constraints between dynamic and non-dynamic
                    bodies are managed in the islands.)
