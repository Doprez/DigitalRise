                    In theory, any opaque object can act as an occluders. However, most in-game models are too
                    complex to be considered as occluders. DigitalRise Graphics therefore uses "occlusion proxies".
                    This means, occluders are artist-authored triangle meshes. These lightweight triangle meshes
                    are used in place of the actual models during occlusion culling. Occluders are usually created
                    as part of a model in the 3D modeling tool (see

                    But they can also be created at runtime using code.

                    The class <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:DigitalRise.Graphics.Occluder</codeEntityReference>
                    represents the occluder geometry. The <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:DigitalRise.Graphics.Occluder</codeEntityReference>
                    can be assigned to a mesh (see property <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="true">P:DigitalRise.Graphics.Mesh.Occluder</codeEntityReference>)
                    or to an <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:DigitalRise.Graphics.SceneGraph.OccluderNode</codeEntityReference>.

                    The following scene nodes act as occluders during occlusion culling:

                    <listItem>
                        An <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:DigitalRise.Graphics.SceneGraph.OccluderNode</codeEntityReference>
                        positions an occluder within a 3D scene. The sole purpose of this scene node is to
                        provide an occluder for occlusion culling.

                        A <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:DigitalRise.Graphics.SceneGraph.MeshNode</codeEntityReference>
                        acts as an occluder when its mesh has an occluder (see property <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="true">P:DigitalRise.Graphics.Mesh.Occluder</codeEntityReference>).

                        A <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">T:DigitalRise.Graphics.SceneGraph.LodGroupNode</codeEntityReference>
                        acts as an occluder when LOD0 (the highest level of detail) has as an occluder.
