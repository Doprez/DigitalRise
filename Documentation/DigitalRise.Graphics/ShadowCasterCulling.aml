            <para>
                Rendering shadow maps can be expensive in large scenes. Directional lights, like the sun,
                usually cover the entire level. Modern shadow mapping algorithms, such as cascaded shadow
                maps, limit the distance up to which shadows are rendered. Still, this may leave us with
                hundreds or thousands of shadow casting objects that need to be rendered into a shadow map.
                <newTerm>Shadow caster culling</newTerm> reduces the number of shadow casters further by
                removing shadow casters that do not contribute to the final image.

                            As a first step the bounds of the shadow casters are compared with the light frustum.
                            Shadow casters that do not intersect with the light frustum are marked as hidden.

                            light as six 90° frustums. In case of a directional light, the light frustum is an
                            orthographic frustum, which needs to be large enough to cover the viewing frustum and
                            catch all shadow casters in front of the light source.)

                            The occluders are rendered from the light's perspective and the bounds of the shadow
                            casters are tested against the occluders. Shadow casters that are occluded from the
                            light's perspective are marked as hidden.

                            Next, the extent of the shadow is estimated. The resulting shadow volume is compared
                            with the viewing frustum. If the shadow volume does not intersect with the viewing
                            frustum, the shadow caster is marked as hidden.

                            (1) - (4) gets rid of most shadow casters that do not contribute to the final image.
                            However, there is still a chance that a shadow "just passes through" the view and that
                            the shadow is not cast on an object visible inside the viewing frustum.
                            Bittner et al. have proposed a culling method that solves this issue

                            This step assumes that we have already performed occlusion culling for the objects in
                            the scene. Only objects that are visible from the main camera are potential shadow
                            receivers. We can render all potential shadow receivers as seen from the light source
                            into a mask. Then we can compare the bounds of the shadow casters with this mask.
                            Only shadow casters that overlap with a visible shadow receiver needs to be rendered
                            into the shadow map.

                    Step (5) is not implemented. It is also not desirable in some cases, for example: When a
                    single shadow receiver stretches across the entire level (e.g. a landscape mesh), then (5)
                    has no effect. When rendering volumetric effects, (5) might remove shadow casters that are
                    actually needed in the shadow map.

                    number of shadow casters – shadow caster culling is not necessary/efficient.

                <para>
                    "Progressive" shadow caster culling is more aggressive than "conservative" shadow caster
                    culling, but may cause problems: In some cases it is not possible to estimate the correct
                    extent of the shadow volume. A shadow caster might be culled, even though its shadow should be
                    visible. Shadows can start to flicker.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The problem is caused by steps (3) and (4) because they require the extent of the shadow
                    volume. The bounds of the shadow caster are defined, but the extent of the shadow volume,
                    i.e. the distance at which the shadow ends in the scene, is not available. It is estimated
                    by reading the maximum depth from the HZB during occlusion culling. Using this solution
                    the extent of the shadow volume is the distance from the shadow caster to the furthest
                    occluder behind the shadow caster. However, this method is unreliable if an object is both
                    a shadow caster and an occluder at the same time. In this situation the following problems
                    can occur:
                </para>
                <list class="bullet">
                    <listItem>
                        The occluder occludes its own shadow volume. Hence, the actual depth of the shadow
                        volume is not available. This case is rare because it only happens when the occluder
                        is rectangular and perfectly axis-aligned with the light frustum. In all other cases,
                        the tested shadow volume area is larger than the occluder and some HZB samples will
                        not contain the occluder.
                    </listItem>
                    <listItem>
                        However, this may still be a problem when the shadow caster is completely surrounded
                        by other occluders. In this case, the maximum depth behind the shadow caster is not be available in the HZB.

                <para>
                    In these cases the estimated extent of the shadow volume is too small and the shadow
                    caster may be culled, which causes flickering or missing shadows. Both cases are rare, but
                    they can be examined in the <legacyItalic>OcclusionCullingSample</legacyItalic>
