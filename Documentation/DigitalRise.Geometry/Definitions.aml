                    <content>
                        <para>
                            The coordinate system that is fixed on an object is called <newTerm>local space</newTerm>
                            (other common terms are <newTerm>object space</newTerm>, <newTerm>child space</newTerm>,
                            <newTerm>body space</newTerm>). The world coordinate space is called
                            <newTerm>world space</newTerm> (other common terms are <newTerm>global space</newTerm>,
                            <newTerm>parent space</newTerm>). Some methods and properties have the
                            words "Local" or "World" in their name to indicate the used space.
                            If an object is nested inside another object, then nested coordinate spaces
                            are created. In this case the <legacyItalic>world space</legacyItalic> of the
                            nested object is equal to the <legacyItalic>localSpace</legacyItalic> of the
                            parent object. Only if an object is not nested inside another object
                            <legacyItalic>world space</legacyItalic> is identical to the global, fixed
                            world coordinate system.

                        <para>
                            We use the term <newTerm>pose</newTerm> to refer to the position and
                            orientation of an object in the world.

                            A <newTerm>shape</newTerm> defines the space that is occupied by an

                            A <newTerm>geometric object</newTerm> is an object that has a pose and
                            a shape.

                        <para>
                            The terms <newTerm>collision</newTerm> and <newTerm>contact</newTerm> are used
                            identically in this documentation. Two objects <newTerm>are in contact</newTerm>
                            if the geometries touch each other (with or without penetration).
                            That means, if the distance between two object is exactly 0, they are in
                            contact. The terms <legacyItalic>touch/intersect/overlap</legacyItalic> are
                            used interchangeably to describe that two object have contact.

                    <title>Separation distance and penetration depth</title>
                    <content>
                        <para>
                            The <legacyItalic>separation distance</legacyItalic> (or short
                            <legacyItalic>distance</legacyItalic>) of two separated objects is the
                            minimum distance between the closest points on the objects. If the objects are penetrating, the separation
                            distance is negative. Two object have contact if their separation distance is less than or equal
                            to 0.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            The <legacyItalic>penetration depth</legacyItalic> of two penetrating objects is the distance
                            that one object has to move to remove the penetration. If the objects
                            are separated, the penetration depth is negative.
                            Two object have contact if their penetration depth is greater than or equal
                            to 0.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            The separation distance is the inverse of the penetration depth:
                            <math>SeparationDistance = -PenetrationDepth</math>
                        </para>
